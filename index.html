      <p class="text-lg text-center">
        Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file. 
        Tailwind is a CSS framework that provides us with single-purpose utility classes which are opinionated for the most part, and which help us design our web pages from right inside our markup or . js/. 
        There are many benefits to using Tailwind CSS as opposed to using a traditional UI kit. Let's go over some of the important benefits. First, Tailwind CSS gives you a smaller CSS file size. Styling your web application with pure CSS requires you to write more CSS as you add more features and components to your web app.
